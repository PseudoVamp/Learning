        <h2>What got me interested</h2>
        <p class="blogText">
          I'm always bad about journaling or writing about myself, so this will
          most likely be some free flowing thought process... but heres what
          drove me to create this website in the first place. I started working
          as a phlebotomist when I was 19. After a number of years doing that I
          figured I needed to go back to school to progress in some meaningful
          way. I chose an associates degree in Medical Laboratory technology,
          seeing as I had worked in the lab for so long it was pretty much the
          next logical step. I took classes part time and eventually finished
          the degree after three or so years of working at it. I became a
          licensed Medical Laboratory Technician in June of 2021. At the time of
          writing this I have been doing that job for a little over a year now.
          I know that doesn't seem like much but let me tell you I am already
          burnt out and hate my job. All of the struggles that everyone faced
          over the past few years have made me resent getting a degree in this
          field. The patients / working conditions / general functions of the
          job drive me absolutely nuts. In my free time I spend most of my days
          playing games on my PC or playing my guitar. I have been using a
          computer since I was about eight and it seems like an extention of my
          body in terms of usefullness. I decided to take a hard left and decide
          to try my hand at programming / becoming some sort of developer. I'm
          about two months or so into my journey and will be using this "blog"
          (ugh I hate that term) to document my learning experiences and for
          practice every few days.

        <h2>May to June</h2>
        <p class="blogText">
          I was definitely stuck in the same boat as a lot of other people...
          "WHERE DO I START?!?". There were too many resources out there and I
          kept jumping from one to the other. Until I finally foud a decent site
          that had a sale on an online course. I figured 15$, why not. So I
          bought "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022" by Colt Steele. I finally had
          some direction and something I could force myself to stick to from
          start to finish. It is well organized and being recorded lessons helps
          to be able to replay things I don't quite get the first time. Between
          that and searching on reddit/r/learnprogramming I luckily found a very
          helpful mentor who goes by "Rainer". I had found a community of other
          people learning sharing their struggles. It finally feels like I'm
          going to be getting somewhere with this! These two months were mainly
          spent learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

        <h2>~July, first week</h2>
        <p class="blogText">
          July has been all about javascript. I have finished the beginner
          secctions in the udemy course on HTML and CSS and have begun dabbling
          in javascript. I have made it through a few sections and done basic
          things like declare variables... let/var/const. Learned about arrays
          and how their index starts at 0 which trips me up everytime. With
          those things under my belt the course progressed into some basic
          functions, for if else, and using those I did a tutorial to build a
          todo list. Very basic and only useful if you have the terminal open. I
          can't wait to start actually putting stuff onto the web page and being
          able to see it outside the console.
